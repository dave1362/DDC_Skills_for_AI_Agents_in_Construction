# Interoperability Analyzer

## Overview

Based on DDC methodology (Chapter 3.5), this skill implements analyze data interoperability issues in construction projects.

**Book Reference:** "Проблемы работы с данными в строительной отрасли" / "Data Challenges in Construction"

## Use Case

Identify format incompatibilities and data loss points

## Key Topics from DDC Book

- Proprietary Data
- Bim Myths
- Interoperability
- Industry 4.0

## Implementation

```python
# Example implementation based on DDC methodology
# See DDC Book Chapter 3.5 for detailed guidance

def interoperability_analyzer(data):
    """
    Analyze data interoperability issues in construction projects

    Args:
        data: Input data for processing

    Returns:
        Processed result
    """
    # Implementation based on DDC methodology
    pass
```

## Best Practices from DDC Book

1. Follow data-driven approach for decision making
2. Ensure data quality before processing
3. Use appropriate data formats and structures
4. Validate results against requirements
5. Document assumptions and methodology
