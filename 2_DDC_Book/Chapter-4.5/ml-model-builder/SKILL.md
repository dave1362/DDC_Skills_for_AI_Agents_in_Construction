# Ml Model Builder

## Overview

Based on DDC methodology (Chapter 4.5), this skill implements build ml models for construction predictions.

**Book Reference:** "Будущее: прогнозы и машинное обучение" / "Future: Predictions and Machine Learning"

## Use Case

Train custom models for cost, time, risk prediction

## Key Topics from DDC Book

- Ml
- Predictions
- Linear Regression
- Knn
- Cost Prediction
- Duration Prediction

## Implementation

```python
# Example implementation based on DDC methodology
# See DDC Book Chapter 4.5 for detailed guidance

def ml_model_builder(data):
    """
    Build ML models for construction predictions

    Args:
        data: Input data for processing

    Returns:
        Processed result
    """
    # Implementation based on DDC methodology
    pass
```

## Best Practices from DDC Book

1. Follow data-driven approach for decision making
2. Ensure data quality before processing
3. Use appropriate data formats and structures
4. Validate results against requirements
5. Document assumptions and methodology
